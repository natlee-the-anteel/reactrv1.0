REACTRv5 (Rapid Exploration and Automated Characterization Tool for Research)

steps for users
if you want to load new genomes
    1. edit the taxonomy IDs in the config.yaml
    2. delete the folder "reactr/data" if applicable
    3. run "snakemake -s LoadDatasets.smk --cores 8 --rerun-incomplete --forceall -p"
    4. wait. it will take sometime (usually ~15 minutes at least on average)
if you are content with the current genomes or don't have one yet
    1. edit in desired protein fasta(s) from the base genome, into "query/true_query.fasta"
    2. check if it matches the base genome and ideally, the same sequenced version
    3. delete the folder "reactr/output" if applicable
    4. run "snakemake -s MainPipeline.smk --cores all --rerun-incomplete --forceall -p"
    5. wait. this should take a few minutes max, though it scales with the number of proteins you query
    6. run "snakemake -s MainPipeline.smk --cores all --rerun-incomplete --forceall -p" again

Note for step 1:
    its highly recommended, for accuracy, that you put a gene FAMILY's fastas into the the true_query file
    rather than just a singular gene. however, it's not the end of the world if you cant; we automatically
    do a blastp on your arabidopsis query against the arabidopsis genome, just to find similar arabdiposis genes
    when building trees/meme/msa --to note, we get rid of all duplicates
    it's also highly recommeneded, for clarity, that your gene headers for true_query.fasta are the common gene ID
    i.e. AT2G45160 rather than something like NP_182041.1

    Runtime
        iqtree takes decent amount of time, primer search takes a lot of time (we've commented it out), uploading 
        new genomes also takes a bunch of time (mostly became of gmap databse loading)
        everything else should generally run decently fast.
    Only doing certain things
        sure. all you need to do is comment out what you dont want in
        the top of mainpipeline.smk rule all: input: etc (begins right around line 30). 
        do it line by line, but be aware that if that thing is demanded in line after it, it will still run
    taxononomy IDs
        we only select one sequenced version for simplicity, but be aware that it might not be the correct strain or correct
        sequenced dataset that you may want (i.e. you might get West Indian avocado instead of Hass avocado)
        you can manually upload your data, but make sure the paths are updated
        and the folder format is wildcard_constraints
    What are your future directions?
        trying to add more modules (i.e. gRNA design, gene expression incorportation, etc)
        would also love to see if possible to run this on ALL species and GENOME inputs
        instead of individual fastas, reach out if you want to collaborate
        also trying to get runtime down, especially species loading, if not possible, am also looking
        into getting servers or more powerful computers that can do this FASTA (pun intended).

## 1. System Preparation
Before installing the software, you must prepare the MacOS environment to handle developer tools and older bioinformatics binaries.
    1. Open Terminal (Command + Space, type "Terminal").
    2. Install Apple Command Line Tools:
    xcode-select --install
    3. Install Rosetta 2 (Required for M1/M2/M3 Macs):
    softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license

## 2. Installation of Package Manager (Miniforge)
We use Miniforge to manage software dependencies automatically.
    1. Download and run the installer:
    curl -L https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh -o miniforge.sh
    bash miniforge.sh

## 3. Startup the environment
    run "conda env create --file environment.yaml" while in the reactrv3 directory

## 4. Activate the environment
    run "conda activate reactrv3"

## 5. Download the non-conda tools
    1. for Flashfry
        0. make sure you have java installed
        1. navigate to the /preset folder in reactrv3 
        2. run wget https://github.com/mckennalab/FlashFry/releases/download/1.15/FlashFry-assembly-1.15.jar
        3. rename that Flashfry java file to FlashFry.jar
    2. for MCScanX
        1. make sure you're still in the /preset directory
        2. download MCSCANX: https://github.com/wyp1125/MCScanX
        3. unzip MCscanx.zip, navigate to that directory, then $make it
        4. the main programs that are necesary are "MCScanX" and "duplicate_gene_classifier," move them into the larger /preset directory
        5. delete the other programs if needed
    3. for pfam database
        0. note that this is pretty larger
        1. go to https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/download/Pfam/ and download "Pfam-A models"
        2. move the resultant downloads (Pfam-A.hmm), into the reactrv3/preset folder
        3. run hmmpress -f preset/pfam/Pfam-A.hmm
